[Domain 8](#domain8-top) **Software Development Security**

[8.1](#8.1) Understand and integrate security in the Software Develoment Life Cycle (SDLC)
Certainly! Here's a concise summary of key points related to integrating security into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**:
   - Understand and integrate security throughout the SDLC.
   - Enforce security controls in the development environmentÂ¹.

**Development Methodologies**:
   - **Build and Fix**:
     - Reactive approach.
     - No key architecture design.
     - Problems fixed as they occur.
     - No formal feedback cycle.
       
   - **Waterfall**:
     - Linear sequential lifecycle.
     - Each phase completed before moving on.
     - No formal way to make changes during the cycle.
     - Project ends before collecting feedback and restarting.

**High-Level Languages**:
   - Very high-level, processor-independent programming languages.
   - Use IF, THEN, and ELSE statements as part of the code logic.
   - Examples: Python, C++, C#, Java.

**Access Control**:
   - **Content Dependent Access Control**: Access based on data sensitivity.
   - **Context Dependent Access Control**: Access via location, time of day, and previous access history.

**Software Version Control (SVC)**:
   - Methodology for storing and tracking changes to software.

Remember that integrating security into the SDLC is crucial for building secure software systems!

**Software Development Phases:**
- Understand the main phases: requirements, acquisition (development), test and evaluation, and commissioning/decommissioning.
- Integrate security throughout these phases.

**Development Security Controls**:
- Apply secure coding techniques to meet standards and best practices.
- Consider controls for programming languages, libraries, runtimes, code repositories, IDEs, and toolsets.
