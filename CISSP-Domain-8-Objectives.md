[Domain 8](#domain8-top) **Software Development Security**

[8.1](#8.1) Understand and integrate security in the Software Develoment Life Cycle (SDLC)

Here's a concise summary of key points related to integrating security into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**:
   - Understand and integrate security throughout the SDLC.
   - Enforce security controls in the development environment¹.

**Development Methodologies**:
   - **Build and Fix**:
     - Reactive approach.
     - No key architecture design.
     - Problems fixed as they occur.
     - No formal feedback cycle.
    
   - **Waterfall**:
     - Linear sequential lifecycle.
     - Each phase completed before moving on.
     - No formal way to make changes during the cycle.
     - Project ends before collecting feedback and restarting.

**High-Level Languages**:
   - Very high-level, processor-independent programming languages.
   - Use IF, THEN, and ELSE statements as part of the code logic.
   - Examples: Python, C++, C#, Java.

**Access Control**:
   - **Content Dependent Access Control**: Access based on data sensitivity.
   - **Context Dependent Access Control**: Access via location, time of day, and previous access history.

**Software Version Control (SVC)**:
   - Methodology for storing and tracking changes to software.

Remember that integrating security into the SDLC is crucial for building secure software systems. 

[8.2](#8.2) Identify and apply security controls in software development ecosystems

**Software Development Phases:**
- Understand the main phases: requirements, acquisition (development), test and evaluation, and commissioning/decommissioning.
- Integrate security throughout these phases.

**Development Security Controls**:
- Apply secure coding techniques to meet standards and best practices.
- Consider controls for programming languages, libraries, runtimes, code repositories, IDEs, and toolsets.


[8.3](#8.3) Assess the effectiveness of software security

**Application Security Testing**:
   - Use techniques like Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and software composition analysis.
   - Assess the security impact of acquired software (e.g., commercial-off-the-shelf or open source).
   - Implement auditing and logging of changes.
   - Conduct risk analysis and mitigation⁴.

[8.4](#8.4) Assess security impact of acquired software

When assessing the security impact of acquired software, consider the following key points:

**Source Code and Repository Review**:
   - Analyze the acquired source code for security vulnerabilities.
   - Review repository access controls and design.
   - Assess intellectual property rights and licensing.

**Development Cycle Phases**:
   - Evaluate security throughout the software development life cycle.
   - Consider security during requirements, acquisition (development), testing, and commissioning/decommissioning phases.

Remember that thorough assessment of acquired software helps ensure its security and reliability.


[8.5](#8.5) Define and apply secure coding guidelines and standards

Here are the key study points related to defining and applying secure coding guidelines and standards:

**Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Organizations that develop software need to establish policies and standards for source code development.
   - These guidelines aim to reduce vulnerabilities that could lead to errors, incidents, and security breaches⁵.

**Security Weaknesses at Source Code Level**:
   - Understand common security weaknesses in code.
   - Address issues related to input validation, buffer overflows, and insecure APIs¹.

**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**:
   - Ensure the security of APIs used in software development.
   - Validate input, handle authentication, and protect against attacks like injection and broken access control¹.
