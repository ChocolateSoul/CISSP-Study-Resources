[Domain 6](#domain6-top) **Security Assessment and Testing**

- Security assessment and testing program are an important mechanism for validating the on-going effectiveness of security controls
    - they include a variety of tools, such as vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, software testing, audits, and other control validation
- Every org should have a security assessment and testing program defined and operational
- **Security assessments**: comprehensive reviews of the security of a system, application, or other tested environment
    - during a security assessment, a trained information security professional performs a risk assessment that identifies vulnerabilities in the tested environment that may allow a compromise and makes recommendations for remediation, as needed
    - a security assessment includes the use of security testing tools, but go beyond scanning and manual penetration tests
    - the main work product of a security assessment is normally an assessment report addressed to management that contains the results of the assessment in nontechnical language and concludes with specific recommendations for improving the security of the tested environment
- An organization’s audit strategy will depend on its size, industry, financial status and other factors
    - a small non-profit, a small private company and a small public company will have different requirements and goals for their audit strategies
    - the audit strategy should be assessed and tested regularly to ensure that the organization is not doing a disservice to itself with the current strategy
    - there are three types of audit strategies: internal, external, and third-party
    
[6.1](#6.1) Design and validate assessment, test, and audit strategies (OSG-9 Chpt 15)
- 6.1.1 Internal
    - An organization’s security staff can perform security tests and assessments, and the results are meant for internal use only, designed to evaluate controls with an eye toward finding potential improvements
    - An internal audit strategy should be aligned to the organization’s business and day-to-day operations
        - e.g. a publicly traded company will have a more rigorous internal auditing strategy than a privately held company
    - Designing the audit strategy should include laying out applicable regulatory requirements and compliance goals
    - Internal audits are performed by an organization’s internal audit staff and are typically intended for internal audiences
