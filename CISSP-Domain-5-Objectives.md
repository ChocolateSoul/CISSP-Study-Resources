[Domain 5](#domain5-top) **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

The identity and Access Management (IAM) domain focuses on issues related to granting and revoking privileges to access data or perform actions on systems
- Assets include information, systems, devices, facilities, and applications
- Organizations use both physical and logical access controls to protect them
- Identification is the process of a subject claiming, or professing, an identity
- Authentication verifies the subject’s identity by comparing one or more authentication factors against a database holding authentication info for users
- The three primary authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and something you are
- Single sign-on (SSO) technologies allow users to authenticate once and access any resources in a network or the cloud, without authenticating again
- Federated Identity Management (FIM) systems link user identities in one system with other systems to implement SSO

[5.1](#5.1) Control physical and logical access to assets (OSG-9 Chpt 13)
- Controlling access to assets (tangible: things you can touch, or nontangible: info and data) is a central theme of security
- In addition to personnel, assets can be information, systems, devices, facilities, or applications:
    - 5.1.1 Information: an org’s information includes all of its data, stored in simple files (on servers, computers, and small devices), or in databases
    - 5.1.2 Systems: an org’s systems include anything that provide one or more services; a web server with a database is a system; permissions assigned to user and system accounts control system access
    - 5.1.3 Devices: refers to any computing system (e.g. routers & switches, smartphones, laptops, and printers); BYOD has been increasingly adopted, and the data stored on the devices is still an asset to the org
    - 5.1.4 Facilities: any physical location, building, rooms, complexes etc; physical security controls are important to help protect facilities
    - 5.1.5 Applications: apps provide access to data; permissions are an easy way to restrict logical access to apps
- Understand what assets you have, and how to protect them
    - **physical security controls**: such as perimeter security and environmental controls
        - control access and the environment
    - **logical access controls**: technical controls used to protect access to information, systems, devices, and applications
        - includes authentication, authorization, and permissions
        - permissions help ensure only authorized entities can access data
        - logical controls restrict access to config settings on systems/networks to only authed individuals
        - applies to on-prem and cloud

[5.2](#5.2) Manage identification and authentication of people, devices, and services (OSG-9 Chpt 13)
- **Identification**: the process of a subject claiming, or professing an identity
- **Authentication**: verifies the subject’s identity by comparing one or more factors against a database of valid identities, such as user accounts
    - a core principle with authentication is that all subjects must have unique identities
    - identification and authentication occur together as a single two-step process
    - users identify themselves with usernames and authenticate (or prove their identity) with passwords
- 5.2.1 Identiy management (IdM) implementation
    - Identity and access management is a collection of processes and techologies that are used to control access to critical assets; it's purpose is the management of access to information, systems, devices, and facilities
    - Identity Management (IdM) implementation techniques generally fall into two categories:
        - **centralized access control**: implies a single entity within a system performs all authorization verification
            - potentially creates a single point of failure
            - small team can manage initially, and can scale to more users
        - **decentralized access control**: (AKA distributed access control) implies several entities located throughout a system perform auth verification
            - requires more individuals or teams to manage, and admin may be spred across numerous locations
            - difficult to maintain consistency
            - changes made to any individual access control point needs to be repeated at others
    - With ubiquitious mobile computing and anywhere, anytime access (to apps & data), identity is the "new perimeter"
- 5.2.2 Single/Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    - **Single-factor authentication**: any authentication using only one proof of identity
    - **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**: requires two different proofs of identity
    - **Multifactor authentication (MFA)**: any authentication using two or more factors
        - multifactor auth must use multiple types or factors, such as something you know and something you have
        - note: requiring users to enter a password and a PIN is NOT multifactor (both are something you know)
    - Two-factor methods:
        - **Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**: includes a hash function used by the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) standard to create onetime passwords
        - **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)**: similar to HOTP, but uses a timestamp and remains valid for a certain time frame (e.g. 30 or 60 seconds)
            - e.g. phone-based authenticator app, where your phone is mimicking a hardware TOTP token (combined with userid/password is considered two-factor or two-step authentication)
        - **Email challenge**: popular method, used by websites, sending the user an email with a PIN
        - Short Message Service (SMS) to send users a text with a PIN is another 2-factor method; note that NIST SP 800-63B points out vulnerabilities, and deprecates use of SMS as a two-factor method for federal agencies
- 5.2.3 Accountability
    - Two important security elements in an access control system are authorization and accountability
        - **Authorization**: subjects are granted access to objects based on proven identities
        - **Accountability**: users and other subjects can be held accountable for their actions when auditing is implemented
    - **Auditing**: tracks subjects and records when they access objects, creating an audit trail in one or more audit logs
    - Auditing provides accountability
- 5.2.4 Session management
    - Session management is important to use with any type of authentication system to prevent unauthorized access
    - Desktop/laptops: recommendation to use screensavers, although modern OSs have timeout/lock features
    - Secure online sessions should terminate after a timeout period
    - The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes “cheat sheets” that provide app developer’s specific recommendations
- 5.2.5 Registration, proofing, and establishment of identity
    - Within an organization, new employees prove their identity with appropriate documentation during the hiring process
        - in-person identity proofing includes things like passport, DL, birth cert etc
    - Online orgs often use knowledge-based authentication (KBA) for identity-proofing of someone new (e.g. a new customer creating a new bank/savings account)
        - example questions include past vehicle purchases, amount of mortgage payment, previous addresses, DL numbers
        - they then query authoritative information (e.g. credit bureaus or gov agencies) for matches
    - Cognitive Passwords: security questions that are gathered during account creation, which are later used as questions for authentication (e.g. name of pet, color of first car etc)
        - one of the flaws associated with cognitive passwords is that the information is often available on social media sites or general internet searches
- 5.2.6 Federated Identity Management (FIM)
    - Federated Identity Management (FIM) systems (a form of SSO) are often used by cloud-based apps
    - A federated identity links a user’s identity in one system with multiple identity management systems
    - FIM allows multiple orgs to join a federation or group, agreeing to share identity information
        - users in each org can log in once in their own org, and their credentials are matched with a federated identity
        - users can then use this federated identity to access resources in any other org within the group
        - where each organization decides what resources to share
    - Methods used to implement federated identity management systems include:
        - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
        - OAuth
        - OpenID Connect (OIDC)
    - Cloud-based federation typically uses a third-party service to share federated identities
    - Federated identity management systems can be hosted on-premises, in the cloud, or in a combination of the two as a hybrid system
- 5.2.7 Credential management systems
    - **Credential management systems**: provide storage space for usernames and password
        - e.g. web browsers that remember usernames and passwords for visited sites
    - The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the Credential Management Level 1 API as a working draft in January 2019, which many browsers have adopted
    - Some federated identity management solutions use the Credential Management API, allowing web apps to implement SSO using a federated identity provider
        - e.g. using your Google or Facebook account to sign into Zoom
- 5.2.8 Singe Sign On (SSO)
    - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: a centralized access control technique allowing a subject to be authenticated once on a system and access multiple resources without authenticating again
    - Advantages of using SSO include:
        - reduces the number of passwords that users need to remember, and they are less likely to write them down
        - eases administration by reducing the number of accounts
    - Disadvantages:
        - once an account is compromised, an attacker gains unrestricted access to all of the authorized resources
    - Within an organization, a central access control system, such as a directory service, is often used for SSO
        - **directory service**: a centralized database that includes information about subjects and objects, including authentication data
        - many directory services are based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- 5.2.9 Just-In_time (JIT)
    - Federated identity solutions that support just-in-time (JIT) provisioning automatically create the relationship between two entities so that new users can access resources
    - A JIT solution creates the connection without any administrative intervention
    - JIT systems commonly use SAML to exchange required data

[5.3](#5.3) Federated Identity with a third-party service (OSG-9 Chpt 13)
- 5.3.1 On-premise
    - Federated identity management can be hosted on-premise, and typically provides an organization with the most control
- 5.3.2 Cloud
    - Cloud-based apps used federated identify management (FIM) systems, which are a form of SSO
    - Cloud-based federation typically uses a third-party service to hsare federated identities (e.g. training sites use federated SSO systems)
        - commonly matching the user's internal login ID with a federated identify
- 5.3.3 Hybrid
    - A hybrid federation is a combination of a cloud-based solution and an on-premise solution

[5.4](#5.4) Implement and manage authorization mechanisms (OSG-9 Chpt 14)
- 5.4.1 Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
    - A key characteristic of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is the use of roles or groups
    - Instead of assigning permissions directly to users, user accounts are placed in roles and administrators assign privileges to the roles (typically defined by job function)
        - if the user account is in a role, the user has all privileges assigned to the role
    - MS Windows OS uses this model with groups
- 5.4.2 Rule Based access control
    - A key characteristic of the Rule-Based access control model is that it applies global rules to all subjects
        - e.g. firewalls uses rules that allow or block traffic to all users equally
    - Rules within the rule-based access control model are sometimes referred to as restrictions or filters
- 5.4.3 Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
    - A key characteristic of the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) model is the use of labels applied to both subjects and objects
        - e.g. a label of top secret grants access to top-secret documents
    - When documented in a table, the MAC model sometimes resembles a lattice (i.e. climbing rosebush framework), so it is referred to as a lattice-based model
- 5.4.4 Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
    - A key characteristic of the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model is that every object has an owner, and the owner can grant or deny access to any other subjects
        - e.g. you create a file and are the owner, and can grant permissions to that file
    - New Technology File System (NTFS) used in Windows, uses the DAC model
- 5.4.5 Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)
    - A key characteristic of the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is its use of rules that can include multiple attributes
        - this allows it to be much more flexible than a rule-based access control model that applies the rules to all subjects equally
        - many software-defined networks (SDNs) use the ABAC model
    - ABAC allows administrators to create rules within a policy using plain language statements such as “Allow Managers to access the WAN using a mobile device”
- 5.4.6 Risk based access control
    - Risk-based access control model grants access after evaluating risk; evaluating the environment and the situation and making risk-based decisions using policies embeded within software
    - Using machine learning, making predictive conclusions about current activity based on past activity

- 5.5.1 Account accesss review
- 5.5.2 Provisioning and deprovisioning
- 5.5.3 Role definition
- 5.5.4 Privilege escalation (e.g. managed service accounts, use of usdo, minimizing its use)

[5.6](#5.6) Implement authentication systems (OSG-9 Chpt 14)
- 5.6.1 OpenID Connect (OIDC) / Open Authorization (Oauth)
- 5.6.2 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
- 5.6.3 Kerberos
- 5.6.4 Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) / Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
